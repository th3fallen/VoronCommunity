# VoronCommunity repository

Welcome to the VoronCommunity github repository. This is a place to share your awesome mods for the Voron0, Voron1 and Voron2 3D printers and find useful resources from other Voron community members.

This is a forked repo based on the amazing [VoronUsers](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers) Repository with the goal of faster merging of submissions with less review. so mods are to be used very much at your own risk and comfort.

Check the [`printer_mods`](./printer_mods) [`firmware_configurations`](./firmware_configurations) and [`slicer_configurations`](./slicer_configurations) folders for mods that apply to 
the current generation of printers. All mods that apply to older (=legacy printers) can be found in the [legacy printers](./legacy_printers) folder.
